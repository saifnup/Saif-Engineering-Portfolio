title: "Automonous Rover"
description: "Design and construction of a remote-controlled rover capable of transporting a golf ball through an obstacle course, lifting a bar, and releasing the ball into a target hole."
timeline: "Jan 2025 – April 2025"

The rover features a polycarbonate 3D-printed chassis with 20% infill, optimized for both weight and strength. Motion is provided via independent wheel drive using FS90R servos, with transfer bearings incorporated to reduce friction. The rover includes a servo-actuated ball release mechanism with an integrated ramp and gate, and a four-bar linkage bar lifting mechanism controlled by a separate servo. Wireless control is achieved using an Arduino Mega and Arduino Nano communicating via nRF24l01+ transceivers at 2.4 GHz, while onboard power is supplied by two 9 V batteries connected in parallel. The total project cost was kept under $120, with several pre-owned components helping reduce expenses.

### What I Learned

- Effective integration of mechanical design, electrical control, and wireless communication.  
- Optimizing traction and ground clearance improves rover performance over slopes and obstacles.  
- Importance of iterative prototyping and testing to identify and resolve failure modes.  
- Experience in CAD modeling, 3D printing, and servo-actuated mechanism design.  
- Managing project cost and sourcing pre-owned components effectively.
