Drone Afforestation Rover System was developed to demonstrate a low-cost, mechanically-driven seed dispersal platform for afforestation and environmental restoration. The system functioned as a tabletop rover platform to validate controlled, repeatable seed release without requiring full aerial flight.

I led the mechanical design and system integration of the seed dispensing mechanism, rover structure, and hardware prototyping. The system used a rotating gumball-style dispenser driven by an Arduino-controlled motor to release seeds at defined intervals based on rover motion.

This project emphasized rapid prototyping, mechanical reliability, and system-level integration between CAD, electronics, and software.

### What I Learned

- System-level mechanical design for mechatronic platforms  
- Arduino-based motor control and timing logic  
- Rapid prototyping using iterative 3D printing  
- Designing mechanisms for granular material handling  
- Integrating mechanical, electrical, and software subsystems  
- Hardware validation and bench testing for functional reliability
