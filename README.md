• **Customer Lifecycle & Fleet Status Assessment:** Evaluated aircraft operational status and customer activity to understand credit non-utilization drivers, including fleet changes, aircraft retirement, and operational constraints.

• **Global Maintenance Network Exposure & Control:** Monitored improvements using dashboards and Google Analytics while supporting analysis across multiple global MRO facilities (including Brazil and other international sites) to track sustained performance gains.


### Manufacturing Design Intern | **Lighthouse Meta Technologies Inc (Off/Script)**
*May 2025 – August 2025*

Supported a community-driven product creation startup that transforms viral user-submitted ideas into manufactured consumer products. Off/Script managed end-to-end product development, international supplier sourcing and logistics, enabling creators to retain IP while scaling concepts into physical, market-ready products.

**End-to-End Manufacturing Enablement:** Supported the transition of viral digital concepts into manufacturable physical products by preparing CAD-ready designs and defining manufacturing workflows for rapid prototyping and production.

**Supplier & Cost Optimization:** Coordinated with 40+ global suppliers to align minimum order quantities (MOQs), cost-per-unit (CPU), and manufacturing constraints with product and business requirements.

**Design for Manufacturing (DFM):** Performed CAD preparation, slicing, and manufacturability reviews to optimize designs for 3D printing and production, reducing iteration cycles and production risk.

**Cost & Materials Optimization:** Evaluated materials and manufacturing methods across thousands of product concepts to reduce unit cost while maintaining functional and aesthetic requirements.

**Production Scaling & Quoting:** Generated production estimates and feasibility assessments for ~6,000 designs on the Off/Script platform, supporting rapid go/no-go decisions for product launches.

**Cross-Functional Product Delivery:** Worked closely with product, operations, and supplier teams to align design intent with real-world manufacturing capabilities and timelines.
